## Abstract
Indonesian Local Machine Translation initiative, a pioneering project focused on creating a powerful translation mechanism for Indonesia’s multitude of local dialects. With Indonesia’s vast linguistic diversity, encompassing over 17,000 islands, 360 ethnicities, and 840 regional languages, communication becomes a formidable obstacle, impeding social interactions and mutual comprehension among its inhabitants. Our mission is to alleviate these issues by developing a sophisticated translation system aimed at enabling smooth everyday conversations across the wide array of local dialects.


## Datasets
Our work utilizes datasets from NusaX and CC100, specifically for Sundanese and Javanese languages, in addition to pretrained models from Transformers. The NusaX dataset encompasses 12 categorized languages, which include Indonesian, English, and 10 regional Indonesian languages such as Acehnese, Balinese, Banjarese, Bugis, Madurese, Minangkabau, Javanese, Ngaju, Sundanese, and Toba Batak. The CC100 dataset comprises approximately 100 languages, however, we solely employ Javanese and Sundanese for translation between these two languages, due to the constraints of the dataset for other regional languages within CC100.
